# Comprehensive Data Analysis Project: [Financial-Transactions]

This repository contains a full-stack data project that covers the entire data lifecycle, from initial database design and implementation to data analysis, visualization, and final presentation of the findings.

## 📂 Project Workflow

This project is organized into several key stages, with each folder in the repository representing a specific part of the workflow:

1.  **🗂️ `ERD` - Database Design:**
    * Contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).
    * This outlines the database schema, including tables, columns, primary keys, and relationships, providing a blueprint for the database structure.

2.  **💾 `SQL Server` - Database Implementation:**
    * Includes all the SQL scripts required to build and populate the database.
    * This typically contains `CREATE TABLE` statements, `INSERT` scripts for data loading, and any necessary stored procedures or views.

3.  **🐍 `Python` - Data Analysis & Processing:**
    * The core of the analysis is done here using Python.
    * This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for data cleaning, processing, feature engineering, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4.  **📊 `Visualization` - Data Visualization:**
    * This folder holds the outputs of the visualization process.
    * It may contain saved plots and charts generated from Python, or it could house BI tool files (e.g., Power BI `.pbix` or Tableau workbooks).

5.  **🖥️ `Presentation` - Final Report:**
    * Contains the final presentation of the project's findings.
    * This is typically a PowerPoint (`.pptx`) or PDF document summarizing the project's goals, methodology, key insights, and conclusions.
